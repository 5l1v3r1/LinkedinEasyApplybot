# LinkedinEasyApplybot
This bot uses selenium, scrolls through linkedin pages and collects the URLs of the easy apply jobs only and prints it out in a csv or text file.It is assumed before on activates this file that he/she has already signed in to their LinkedIn account. Also, it is assumed that the package selenium is already installed and that that google chrome is the web driver used. It would also be worth mentioning that this code has been written for python 2.7.
